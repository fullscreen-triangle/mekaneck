% This section is intentionally left minimal as the topological network
% content is covered in topological-network.tex. This file exists for
% potential future expansion on gas-phase network topology specifically.

% Gas-phase reactions and their categorical network structure could be
% developed here if needed. Currently, the main topological framework
% is in Section 3 (topological-network.tex).
