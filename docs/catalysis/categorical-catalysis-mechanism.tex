\begin{abstract}
A framework for catalysis based on categorical aperture selection rather than temporal acceleration is presented. Traditional catalysis theory describes catalysts as agents that accelerate reactions by lowering activation energies, implicitly treating time as the fundamental variable and reaction rate enhancement as temporal compression. This temporal interpretation generates three fundamental contradictions. First, the instantaneous concentration paradox: if catalysts accelerate reactions proportionally to substrate availability, arbitrarily high substrate concentrations should yield instantaneous reaction rates, yet Michaelis-Menten kinetics demonstrates finite maximum velocity $V_{\max}$ independent of substrate concentration. Second, the reversible reaction paradox: catalysts accelerate reversible reactions without altering equilibrium constants, requiring simultaneous bidirectional temporal acceleration, which is physically incoherent. Third, the step-exclusion paradox: catalyzed reactions proceed through different intermediates than uncatalyzed reactions, implying catalysts either execute the same steps faster, requiring an energy source for acceleration, or skip steps entirely, rendering those steps unnecessary yet present in uncatalyzed pathways.

These contradictions are resolved by reformulating catalysis as geometric selection through categorical apertures, defined as topological structures in phase-lock network space that permit molecular passage based on configurational compatibility rather than kinetic properties. Categorical apertures operate through structural recognition without information acquisition: the aperture-substrate interaction involves zero Shannon information processing and therefore incurs no Landauer erasure cost, distinguishing categorical selection fundamentally from Maxwell's demon mechanisms that require measurement, decision, and memory erasure. The framework is formalised through three mathematical structures: categorical distance metrics $d_{\mathcal{C}}(C_i, C_j)$ quantifying topological separation between configurational states in phase-lock network space, phase-lock network topology $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ encoding molecular interaction patterns through nodes representing molecular configurations and edges representing phase-coherent couplings, and topological completion conditions $C_i \prec C_j$ defining accessibility relations between categorical states based on network connectivity rather than energy barriers.

Applications to four catalytic systems demonstrate the framework's explanatory power. Analysis of serine protease catalytic triads reveals that the Ser-His-Asp arrangement creates a categorical aperture through precise geometric alignment of the nucleophile, proton shuttle, and electrostatic stabilizer, with the aperture's selectivity arising from topological constraints rather than from activation energy reduction. Carbonic anhydrase, conventionally described as achieving near-diffusion-limited rates through maximal temporal acceleration, is reinterpreted as possessing an optimal geometric aperture structure: the zinc-coordinated hydroxide nucleophile and His64 proton shuttle create minimal categorical distance $d_{\mathcal{C}}$ between substrate and product states, with the turnover number $k_{\text{cat}} \approx 10^6~\text{s}^{-1}$ reflecting geometric optimality rather than temporal speed. The Haber process demonstrates categorical pathway creation: iron catalyst surfaces provide adsorption sites that transform the categorically inaccessible gas-phase N$_2$ dissociation pathway (requiring simultaneous triple-bond cleavage) into a sequence of categorically accessible surface-mediated steps (sequential N-N bond weakening through surface coordination), reducing categorical distance from $d_{\mathcal{C}} \gg 1$ to $d_{\mathcal{C}} \sim 1$ without altering the thermodynamic driving force. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), widely characterized as inefficient due to low turnover number $k_{\text{cat}} \approx 3~\text{s}^{-1}$, is shown to operate in a categorically complex space: the enzyme must discriminate between CO$_2$ and O$_2$ substrates with near-identical geometric and electronic properties while executing a multi-step enolisation-carboxylation-hydration sequence, yielding high categorical distance $d_{\mathcal{C}}$ that cannot be reduced without sacrificing substrate specificity.

The framework establishes that catalytic efficiency metrics such as turnover number $k_{\text{cat}}$ are categorical-space-dependent quantities: $k_{\text{cat}}$ reflects the categorical distance $d_{\mathcal{C}}$ traversed per catalytic cycle, rendering cross-catalyst comparisons undefined unless normalized by categorical complexity. The conventional interpretation of Rubisco as suboptimal, based on comparing its $k_{\text{cat}} \approx 3~\text{s}^{-1}$ to catalase's $k_{\text{cat}} \approx 10^7~\text{s}^{-1}$, constitutes a category error analogous to comparing vehicle speeds across different terrains without accounting for terrain difficulty. Rubisco's low turnover number reflects the high categorical complexity of its reaction space, not evolutionary suboptimality. Attempts to increase Rubisco's $k_{\text{cat}}$ through mutagenesis consistently reduce CO$_2$/O$_2$ specificity, confirming that the enzyme operates at the Pareto frontier of the categorical distance-specificity trade-off.

This framework unifies enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis under a single geometric principle: catalysts function as categorical apertures that reduce topological distance in phase-lock network space through structural complementarity, independent of temporal dynamics. Catalysis emerges as a geometric phenomenon in categorical space rather than a temporal phenomenon in physical space, resolving the contradictions of temporal acceleration theory while providing a foundation for rational catalyst design based on topological principles.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{The Standard Model of Catalysis}
\label{sec:standard_model}

The prevailing theory of catalysis, developed over the past century through the foundational work of Arrhenius, Eyring, Pauling, and their successors, rests on a temporal foundation \citep{arrhenius1889, eyring1935, pauling1946}. Catalysts are described as agents that accelerate chemical reactions by providing alternative reaction pathways characterized by lower activation energies relative to uncatalyzed pathways. This conceptual framework is mathematically formalized through the Arrhenius equation:
\begin{equation}
k = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)
\label{eq:arrhenius}
\end{equation}
where $k$ denotes the rate constant, $A$ represents the pre-exponential frequency factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is absolute temperature. Transition state theory, developed by Eyring and coworkers \citep{eyring1935, evans1935}, extends this framework by treating the reaction coordinate as a path through a potential energy surface, with the transition state representing the highest-energy configuration along this path. According to this theory, catalysts function by stabilizing the transition state relative to reactants, thereby reducing $E_a$ and increasing $k$ according to Equation~\ref{eq:arrhenius}.

This temporal interpretation quantifies catalytic action as acceleration: reducing the activation energy $E_a$ increases the rate constant $k$, causing the reaction to proceed more rapidly. The framework has proven computationally tractable for predicting reaction rates through methods ranging from empirical correlations to quantum chemical calculations of transition state energies \citep{truhlar2006}. It has guided rational catalyst design for decades, particularly in the development of industrial heterogeneous catalysts and the engineering of enzyme variants through directed evolution \citep{arnold2018}.

However, the temporal interpretation contains an implicit but fundamental assumption: that catalysis operates by manipulating time or temporal rates. Under this view, a catalyst causes reactions to occur faster in the sense that the same chemical transformation is compressed into a shorter temporal interval. The reaction pathway may differ between catalyzed and uncatalyzed routes, but the essential mechanism of catalytic action is understood as temporal acceleration. This assumption, while rarely stated explicitly, pervades discussions of catalytic efficiency, turnover numbers, and reaction kinetics.

The temporal framework further assumes that reaction progress can be parameterized by a single coordinate along which the system evolves continuously from reactants through a transition state to products. The activation energy $E_a$ represents the height of the barrier along this coordinate, and catalysis reduces this barrier height. This one-dimensional picture, while mathematically convenient, obscures the multidimensional nature of molecular configuration space and the discrete topological changes that occur during chemical transformations.

\subsection{Contradictions in Temporal Catalysis}
\label{sec:contradictions}

The temporal model, despite its computational utility, generates fundamental contradictions when examined with logical rigor. These contradictions arise not from mathematical inconsistencies within the formalism but from conceptual incoherence in the physical interpretation of catalytic action as temporal acceleration.

\subsubsection{The Instantaneous Concentration Paradox}

The first contradiction concerns the relationship between substrate concentration and reaction velocity. If catalysts accelerate reactions by a factor $\alpha$ that increases with substrate availability, then at sufficiently high substrate concentration $[S]$, the acceleration factor should diverge and reactions should approach instantaneous completion. This expectation follows directly from the temporal interpretation: more substrate molecules provide more opportunities for catalytic encounters per unit time, increasing the effective temporal compression.

However, Michaelis-Menten kinetics, established empirically by \citet{michaelis1913} and derived theoretically through steady-state analysis \citep{briggs1925}, demonstrates saturation behavior:
\begin{equation}
v = \frac{V_{\max}[S]}{K_M + [S]}
\label{eq:michaelis_menten}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is the reaction velocity, $V_{\max}$ is the maximum velocity, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant. In the limit of infinite substrate concentration:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{[S] \to \infty} v = V_{\max} = k_{\text{cat}}[E]_{\text{total}} < \infty
\label{eq:vmax_limit}
\end{equation}
where $k_{\text{cat}}$ is the turnover number and $[E]_{\text{total}}$ is the total enzyme concentration. The finite value of $V_{\max}$, independent of substrate concentration beyond saturation, contradicts the expectation of unlimited temporal acceleration. If catalysis operates by compressing time, and substrate availability removes rate limitations from substrate binding, then the catalytic step itself should accelerate without bound. The existence of a finite maximum velocity implies that catalysis is not fundamentally temporal acceleration.

The standard resolution within temporal theory invokes the rate-limiting step: $k_{\text{cat}}$ reflects the slowest step in the catalytic cycle, typically product release or a conformational change, and this step cannot be accelerated by increasing substrate concentration. However, this resolution merely relocates the problem: why does this step have a finite rate that cannot be further accelerated? If catalysis is temporal acceleration, what prevents further acceleration of the rate-limiting step? The temporal framework provides no answer beyond asserting that the step is "inherently slow," which is a restatement of the observation rather than an explanation.

\subsubsection{The Reversible Reaction Paradox}

The second contradiction concerns reversible reactions. Enzymes catalyze reversible reactions without altering thermodynamic equilibrium constants, a principle established by \citet{haldane1930} and verified experimentally across numerous enzyme systems \citep{alberty1953}:
\begin{equation}
K_{\text{eq}}^{\text{catalyzed}} = K_{\text{eq}}^{\text{uncatalyzed}} = \frac{k_{\text{forward}}}{k_{\text{reverse}}}
\label{eq:equilibrium_preservation}
\end{equation}
where $K_{\text{eq}}$ is the equilibrium constant and $k_{\text{forward}}$ and $k_{\text{reverse}}$ are the forward and reverse rate constants. Since catalysts increase both rate constants by the same factor $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{k_{\text{forward}}^{\text{cat}}}{k_{\text{reverse}}^{\text{cat}}} = \frac{\alpha k_{\text{forward}}^{\text{uncat}}}{\alpha k_{\text{reverse}}^{\text{uncat}}} = \frac{k_{\text{forward}}^{\text{uncat}}}{k_{\text{reverse}}^{\text{uncat}}} = K_{\text{eq}}
\label{eq:equilibrium_ratio}
\end{equation}
the equilibrium constant remains unchanged.

If catalysis operates through temporal acceleration, this result requires that the catalyst accelerates time equally for both forward and reverse reactions. However, forward and reverse reactions proceed in opposite directions along the reaction coordinate. Temporal acceleration in one direction (reactants $\to$ products) corresponds to time flowing forward, while temporal acceleration in the opposite direction (products $\to$ reactants) corresponds to time flowing backward. Time cannot flow in two directions simultaneously. The only resolution within temporal theory is to assert that catalysts do not actually accelerate time in either direction but merely reduce activation barriers, which accelerates rates without accelerating time itself. This resolution, however, contradicts the fundamental premise that catalysis is temporal acceleration and reduces the temporal interpretation to a metaphor rather than a physical mechanism.

The temporal framework might argue that "acceleration" refers to the rate of barrier crossing rather than time itself, but this distinction is semantic rather than substantive. If the rate of barrier crossing increases, the time required for the crossing decreases, which is temporal acceleration by definition. The paradox remains: how can a single mechanism accelerate processes occurring in opposite temporal directions?

\subsubsection{The Step-Exclusion Paradox}

The third contradiction concerns reaction intermediates. Catalysed reactions proceed through different chemical intermediates than uncatalyzed reactions, a principle established through kinetic isotope effect studies, intermediate trapping experiments, and structural characterisation of enzyme-substrate complexes \citep{fersht1999, hammes2002}. For example, the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of peptide bonds proceeds through a tetrahedral intermediate formed by direct water attack on the carbonyl carbon \citep{radzicka1996}, while serine protease-catalyzed hydrolysis proceeds through a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate formed by nucleophilic attack of the serine hydroxyl group \citep{hedstrom2002}.

This observation generates a logical dilemma within the temporal framework. If catalysts execute the same reaction steps as uncatalyzed pathways but faster, then the intermediates should be identical, contradicting experimental observations. If catalysts skip steps present in the uncatalyzed pathway, then those steps must be unnecessary for the chemical transformation, raising the question of why they occur in the uncatalyzed reaction. If catalysts introduce new steps not present in the uncatalyzed pathway, then the catalyzed reaction is not an accelerated version of the uncatalyzed reaction but a fundamentally different chemical process.

The temporal framework typically resolves this paradox by asserting that catalysts provide alternative pathways with lower overall activation energy, even if individual steps differ. However, this resolution abandons the core claim that catalysis is acceleration. An alternative pathway is not an accelerated version of the original pathway but a different route through configuration space. The temporal interpretation conflates two distinct concepts: acceleration (doing the same thing faster) and pathway alteration (doing a different thing). These concepts are logically incompatible: one cannot simultaneously claim that catalysis accelerates the uncatalyzed reaction and that catalysis proceeds through different intermediates.

Furthermore, if catalysis operates by providing alternative pathways, the question arises: what determines which pathways are accessible? The temporal framework answers in terms of activation energies, but this answer is circular: pathways with lower activation energies are faster, and faster pathways are those with lower activation energies. The framework provides no independent criterion for pathway accessibility beyond the empirical observation that certain pathways occur and others do not.

\subsection{The Demon Analogy and Information-Theoretic Interpretations}
\label{sec:demon_analogy}

The conceptual difficulties of temporal catalysis have led some researchers to invoke information-theoretic mechanisms as alternative or complementary explanations. \citet{haldane1930}, in his pioneering work on enzyme kinetics, proposed that enzymes function analogously to Maxwell's demons, using molecular recognition to generate biological order from thermal disorder. This analogy was developed further by \citet{monod1965} in the context of allosteric regulation, where conformational changes in enzyme structure were interpreted as information processing that couples substrate binding to catalytic activity. More recently, \citet{mizraji2021} formalized this perspective by describing enzymes as "information catalysts" that process Shannon information to select substrates from solution and direct products to specific outcomes.

The Maxwell's demon analogy draws on the thought experiment proposed by \citet{maxwell1867}, in which an intelligent agent sorts molecules by velocity to create a temperature difference without performing work, apparently violating the second law of thermodynamics. The resolution of this paradox, developed by \citet{szilard1929}, \citet{landauer1961}, and \citet{bennett1982}, demonstrates that the demon must acquire information about molecular velocities through measurement, store this information in a memory register, and eventually erase the memory to reset for subsequent operations. The erasure process, according to Landauer's principle \citep{landauer1961}, dissipates a minimum energy of $k_B T \ln 2$ per bit erased, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is temperature. This dissipation compensates for any apparent entropy decrease from the sorting operation, preserving the second law.

If enzymes function as Maxwell's demons, they would require continuous information processing with associated thermodynamic costs. The enzyme would need to measure substrate properties (analogous to measuring molecular velocities), make decisions about substrate binding based on these measurements (analogous to opening or closing the demon's door), store the measurement outcomes during the catalytic cycle, and erase this information before the next cycle. The erasure cost would accumulate with each catalytic turnover, requiring energy input beyond the chemical driving force of the reaction itself.

However, no such information processing has been observed in enzyme catalysis. Enzymes do not measure substrate velocities or any other kinetic properties. Substrate binding depends on configurational complementarity between enzyme active site and substrate geometry, characterized by shape, charge distribution, hydrogen bonding patterns, and hydrophobic interactions \citep{fersht1999}. These are structural properties, not kinetic properties requiring measurement. Enzymes do not store measurement outcomes in any identifiable memory register. The enzyme-substrate complex represents a bound state characterized by specific non-covalent interactions, not a memory state encoding information about substrate properties. Enzymes do not erase memories between catalytic cycles. Product release returns the enzyme to its initial state, but this is a chemical transformation (breaking bonds, releasing molecules) rather than an information erasure operation.

The demon analogy, while intellectually stimulating and useful for conceptual discussions of molecular recognition, does not correspond to the physical mechanisms observed in enzyme catalysis. Enzymes are not information processors in the Shannon sense. They do not acquire, store, or erase information. They are geometric structures that interact with substrates through configurational complementarity, and these interactions follow the ordinary laws of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics without requiring information-theoretic augmentation.

Furthermore, the demon analogy inherits the conceptual problems of temporal catalysis. If the demon selects molecules by velocity to create order, it operates through temporal discrimination (fast versus slow molecules). If enzymes function as demons, they would need to discriminate substrates by kinetic properties, contradicting the observation that substrate binding depends on structural properties. The demon analogy does not resolve the contradictions of temporal catalysis but rather introduces additional complications by invoking information processing that is neither observed experimentally nor required theoretically.

\subsection{The Categorical Alternative}
\label{sec:categorical_alternative}

The present work proposes that catalysis operates neither through temporal acceleration nor through information processing, but through geometric selection in categorical space. This framework rests on four foundational principles that distinguish it fundamentally from temporal and information-theoretic interpretations.

First, chemical reactions traverse discrete categorical states rather than continuous temporal intervals. A categorical state is defined by the topological structure of molecular interactions, specifically the phase-lock network formed by coherent couplings between molecular degrees of freedom \citep{sachikonye2024maxwell}. Phase-lock networks encode which atoms are bonded, which functional groups interact through non-covalent forces, and which molecular configurations are geometrically compatible. Transitions between categorical states correspond to discrete topological changes in this network structure, such as bond formation, bond breaking, or conformational rearrangement. These transitions are not continuous deformations but discrete events characterized by threshold conditions for topological reconfiguration.

Second, catalysts create new categorical pathways by providing geometric apertures that permit passage between states that are categorically distant in the absence of the catalyst. A categorical aperture is defined as a topological structure, typically the active site of an enzyme or the surface geometry of a heterogeneous catalyst, that is geometurally complementary to specific molecular configurations. When a substrate molecule enters the aperture, its phase-lock network couples to the catalyst's phase-lock network, creating a composite system with altered topological structure. This coupling reduces the categorical distance between reactant and product states by introducing intermediate states that are categorically accessible through the composite network but inaccessible in the isolated substrate network.

Third, molecular passage through categorical apertures depends on configuration rather than velocity. Configuration encompasses all structural properties of the molecule: atomic positions, bond angles, charge distribution, dipole moments, hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors, hydrophobic surface area, and conformational flexibility. These properties determine whether the molecule's phase-lock network is topologically compatible with the aperture's phase-lock network. Velocity, being a kinetic property that describes the rate of change of position, does not enter the compatibility criterion. A molecule moving rapidly and a molecule moving slowly have identical configurational properties and therefore identical aperture compatibility. This velocity-independence distinguishes categorical apertures fundamentally from Maxwell's demons, which select by velocity and therefore require measurement of kinetic properties.

Fourth, categorical aperture selection involves zero information acquisition, zero information storage, and zero information erasure. The aperture-substrate interaction is purely structural: the substrate either fits the aperture geometry or does not, determined by physical contact forces (van der Waals interactions, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds) that arise automatically from the quantum mechanical properties of the constituent atoms. No measurement is performed because no property is interrogated and recorded. No decision is made because the interaction outcome (binding or non-binding) follows deterministically from the structural properties. No memory is stored because the bound state is a physical configuration, not an information state. No erasure occurs because there is no memory to erase. The entire process operates through ordinary thermodynamic and quantum mechanical principles without invoking information theory.

These four principles resolve the contradictions of temporal catalysis. The instantaneous concentration paradox dissolves because categorical passage is not temporal acceleration: increasing substrate concentration increases the frequency of aperture encounters but does not change the categorical distance traversed per passage, yielding saturation at $V_{\max}$ when all apertures are occupied. The reversible reaction paradox dissolves because categorical apertures are bidirectional: the same geometric complementarity that permits forward passage (reactants $\to$ products) permits reverse passage (products $\to$ reactants), with the direction determined by thermodynamic driving force rather than temporal flow. The step-exclusion paradox dissolves because catalysts create new categorical pathways rather than accelerating existing pathways: the different intermediates observed in catalyzed reactions reflect the different topological structures accessible through the catalyst's phase-lock network.

The categorical framework further predicts that catalytic efficiency metrics, such as turnover number $k_{\text{cat}}$, are categorical-space-dependent quantities that reflect the topological complexity of the reaction pathway rather than temporal speed. Comparing turnover numbers across different reactions without accounting for categorical distance constitutes a category error analogous to comparing vehicle speeds across different terrains without accounting for terrain difficulty. This prediction has profound implications for understanding enzyme evolution and for rational catalyst design, as will be demonstrated through detailed analysis of specific catalytic systems in subsequent sections.

\subsection{Scope and Organization}
\label{sec:scope}

The present work develops the categorical framework for catalysis through both theoretical formalisation and application to specific catalytic systems. Section~\ref{sec:contradictions_detail} examines the three contradictions of temporal catalysis in detail, demonstrating their logical structure and showing why resolutions within the temporal framework are inadequate. Section~\ref{sec:categorical_apertures} formalizes the concept of categorical apertures, defining the mathematical structures required to describe geometric selection in categorical space and establishing the information-theoretic distinction from Maxwell's demon mechanisms. Section~\ref{sec:phase_lock_networks} develops the phase-lock network formalism, introducing categorical distance metrics and topological completion conditions that govern molecular passage through apertures. Section~\ref{sec:equilibrium} analyzes chemical equilibrium from the categorical perspective, showing how catalysts preserve equilibrium constants through bidirectional aperture accessibility and introducing the concept of the penultimate state. Section~\ref{sec:efficiency_metrics} examines catalytic efficiency metrics, demonstrating that turnover numbers are categorical-space dependent and that cross-catalyst comparisons require normalisation by categorical complexity.

Sections~\ref{sec:carbonic_anhydrase} through \ref{sec:rubisco} apply the framework to four catalytic systems chosen to span the range from simple to complex categorical spaces. Carbonic anhydrase (Section~\ref{sec:carbonic_anhydrase}) represents near-optimal geometric aperture design, with minimal categorical distance between substrate and product states. The Haber process (Section~\ref{sec:haber}) demonstrates categorical pathway creation through heterogeneous catalysis, where iron surfaces transform a categorically inaccessible gas-phase reaction into a sequence of accessible surface-mediated steps. Rubisco (Section~\ref{sec:rubisco}) exemplifies high categorical complexity, where the enzyme must navigate a multidimensional categorical space while maintaining substrate specificity, vindicating its low turnover number as reflective of optimal performance within topological constraints rather than evolutionary suboptimality. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses broader implications for enzyme evolution, catalyst design, and the foundations of chemical kinetics. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the principal results and their significance for understanding catalysis as a geometric phenomenon in categorical space.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%==============================================================================

The categorical framework, grounded in the mathematical identity of categories, oscillations, and partitions, resolves the contradictions inherent in temporal catalysis while providing a unified foundation for understanding both enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis.

The instantaneous concentration paradox dissolves because $V_{\max}$ reflects the partition traversal rate in categorical space rather than a limit on temporal acceleration. The categorical distance $\dcat$ between substrate and product states, measured as the number of partition elements that must be traversed, determines throughput according to
\begin{equation}
V_{\max} = \frac{[E]_{\mathrm{total}}}{\dcat \cdot \tau_{\mathrm{step}}}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{\mathrm{step}}$ is the time per partition transition. Increasing substrate concentration increases the frequency of aperture encounters but cannot reduce the categorical distance $\dcat$ because this quantity is determined by the partition structure of the catalytic pathway, not by kinetic factors.

The reversible reaction paradox dissolves because catalysts create bidirectional partition pathways through which both forward and reverse transitions traverse identical categorical space. The same categorical apertures that permit forward passage permit reverse passage because the partition structure depends only on configurational complementarity, which is symmetric with respect to reaction direction. The categorical distance satisfies
\begin{equation}
\dcat(A \to B) = \dcat(B \to A)
\end{equation}
and consequently $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$ is preserved automatically without requiring any special mechanism for equilibrium maintenance.

The step-exclusion paradox dissolves because catalysts do not execute the same partition steps faster or skip partition steps altogether. Instead, they create entirely new intermediate states, including enzyme-bound complexes and surface-adsorbed species, that constitute a different partition pathway through categorical space. The uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions traverse non-overlapping regions of partition space, and the different intermediates observed experimentally reflect these different partition trajectories rather than acceleration or omission of steps.

The demon analogy fails because enzymes select by configuration rather than by velocity. Configuration is a geometric property that determines participation in the partition structure, and passage through a categorical aperture requires only physical complementarity determined by the structural fit between molecule and aperture geometry. No measurement occurs because no kinetic property is interrogated, no information is acquired because the partition structure is determined by geometry alone, and the Landauer bound does not apply because there is no memory to erase.

The Haber process illustrates categorical pathway creation through partition dynamics. When uncatalyzed, the reaction N$_2$ + 3H$_2$ $\to$ 2NH$_3$ has infinite categorical distance because no partition pathway exists: N$\equiv$N dissociation is categorically inaccessible in the gas phase since no intermediate partition elements connect the N$_2$ molecule to dissociated nitrogen atoms. Iron surfaces create apertures, which are specific geometric arrangements of Fe atoms, where N$_2$ adsorption and subsequent dissociation become categorically possible through new partition elements provided by surface-mediated intermediates. Iron does not accelerate the reaction in any temporal sense; it makes the reaction exist by creating a partition pathway where none existed before.

Rubisco illustrates categorical complexity arising from an extended partition structure. Its low turnover number of approximately 3--10 s$^{-1}$ reflects a categorical distance of approximately 10--15 partition steps required to fix CO$_2$ into organic carbon while maintaining discrimination against O$_2$. Comparing Rubisco to catalase, which has a turnover number of approximately $10^7$ s$^{-1}$ and a categorical distance of approximately 1--2 partition steps, constitutes comparison across incommensurable categorical spaces. Rubisco is not inefficient in any meaningful sense; it navigates an enormous partition landscape that catalase does not enter, and its low turnover number reflects the partition complexity of its reaction rather than evolutionary suboptimality.

The framework unifies enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis under a single partition principle: both operate through geometric apertures that permit passage based on molecular configuration, enabling participation in specific partition structures. The active site of chymotrypsin and the surface of iron are both categorical apertures in this sense. The Ser-His-Asp triad at 2.8--3.0 \AA{} spacing and the Fe(111) hollow sites at 2.5 \AA{} spacing are both geometric constraints that select molecular configurations for topological completion through the partition structure defined by the catalyst.

The ball game thought experiment reveals a deeper structure within the partition framework: catalysis is inherently autocatalytic at the categorical level. When a molecule successfully traverses an aperture from one side of a partition to the other, it creates categorical burden on the receiving side by occupying partition elements that were previously available to block subsequent transits. This burden reduces the receiving side's capacity to prevent further molecular passage, and consequently each successful reaction reduces resistance to the next reaction through positive feedback that is entirely independent of velocity, distance, or time. This partition-based autocatalysis explains cooperativity, allosteric effects, and the characteristic lag-exponential-saturation kinetics observed in many catalyzed reactions.

Conservation provides the final element in the partition picture: complete ``victory'' is meaningless because it is self-defeating. If all reactants convert to products, the forward reaction halts because no reactants remain to traverse the partition, and the total molecular count is conserved. Complete conversion implies zero forward rate, which forces reversal as products begin traversing the partition in the opposite direction. Equilibrium emerges not as a stopping point but as the partition configuration where both forward and reverse processes have sufficient molecules to continue indefinitely, with the rates balanced by the thermodynamic driving force. Dynamic equilibrium corresponds to the state where both partition directions proceed continuously at equal rates, a condition that can be described as sustained mutual activity rather than stasis. This derivation of equilibrium from conservation within the partition framework unifies catalytic efficiency, autocatalysis, and equilibrium thermodynamics within a single categorical picture grounded in the mathematical identity of categories, oscillations, and partitions.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%==============================================================================

This work establishes that catalysis is a geometric phenomenon grounded in the mathematical identity of categories, oscillations, and partitions, rather than a temporal phenomenon involving rate acceleration or an information-theoretic phenomenon involving measurement and decision.

The temporal interpretation of catalysis generates three formal contradictions that cannot be resolved within its own framework. The instantaneous concentration paradox demonstrates that unlimited temporal acceleration is inconsistent with the finite maximum velocity observed in enzyme kinetics. The reversible reaction paradox demonstrates that simultaneous acceleration in opposite temporal directions is physically incoherent. The step-exclusion paradox demonstrates that catalysts cannot both execute the same steps faster and proceed through different intermediates.

The categorical framework resolves these contradictions by reconceptualizing catalysis as partition traversal rather than temporal compression. Catalysts operate as categorical apertures, which are geometric structures that select molecules by configurational complementarity rather than by velocity or other kinetic properties. This selection involves zero Shannon information acquisition, zero information storage, and zero information erasure, and consequently incurs no Landauer erasure cost. The catalytic turnover number $k_{\cat}$ is inversely proportional to categorical distance $\dcat$, which measures the number of partition elements that must be traversed per catalytic cycle. Comparisons of turnover numbers across different categorical spaces are undefined because they conflate reactions with fundamentally different partition complexities.

The framework reveals that enzyme ``inefficiency'' metrics such as low turnover numbers reflect categorical complexity rather than suboptimal evolution. Rubisco's low turnover number is a necessary consequence of its extended partition pathway, not a failure of evolutionary optimization. The invariance of equilibrium constants under catalysis follows directly from the bidirectionality of partition pathways: forward and reverse reactions traverse the same categorical space, differing only in direction. Enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis operate by the same categorical mechanism, whereby geometric aperture selection enables topological completion through the partition structure defined by the catalyst.

The partition framework reveals that catalysis is inherently autocatalytic at the categorical level. Each successful aperture transit creates categorical burden on the receiving partition, reducing resistance to subsequent transits through positive feedback that is entirely independent of velocity, distance, or time. Equilibrium emerges from conservation: complete conversion is self-defeating because it eliminates the molecules required to sustain the forward reaction. Dynamic equilibrium is not stasis but the partition configuration where both forward and reverse processes continue indefinitely at balanced rates.

Catalysis is therefore a geometric phenomenon operating through partition dynamics. Time is not accelerated; information is not processed; molecules traverse categorical space through apertures defined by geometric complementarity. The mathematical identity of categories, oscillations, and partitions provides the theoretical foundation, and the instantiation of categorical oscillation in molecular partition dynamics provides the physical mechanism. Each successful partition transit reduces resistance to the next, making catalysis autocatalytic by its very nature. Complete conversion is impossible because it would halt the reaction entirely, and equilibrium emerges as sustained mutual activity within a conserved partition structure.
